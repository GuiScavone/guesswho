Guess Who game with CLI & GUI

_Welcome to our Guess Who game!_
The main goal of the game is to guess the randomly chosen character in 3 tries, given a set of features you can choose from. The possibilities are endless. 
You'll be able to use the menu with CLI.

When you first load up the game you will be presented with different options on the CLI interface, those being:

 - [x] Player vs Computer;
 - [ ] Player vs Player (currently in development);
 - [x] Exit;

## How to run: 
node main-menu.js

Keep interacting throughout the terminal to get to the final guess. 
Type the number of your chosen interaction followed by the Enter key. 

You can also checkout the GUI that we made for fun, that features a small version of this game using us as characters.

_Have fun, and Guess Who._
